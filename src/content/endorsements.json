    "text": "I have been studying piano with Hannah Elster for about three years. I love music, but have never had quite the artistic fiber. I was therefore lucky to find a very patient teacher.  Piano is my favorite instrument, and also one, if not the most, difficult to learn. As an adult student, I do not always have enough time to practice in between lessons. I am fortunate that my teacher respects my pace, is flexible and as a result, we progress well."
