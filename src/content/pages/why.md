# Why Learn Piano?

Once someone has learned the basics of piano he/she has the ability to pick up most instruments and have an elementary understanding of how to play that instrument. 

## Benefits for Children
Numerous Statistics show that children who study a musical instrument have increased grade point average, better spacial and cognitive skills, and score higher on their SAT's.

### Better Behavior
In a 2000 survey, 73 percent of respondents agree that teens who play an instrument are less likely to have discipline problems.<cite>American Music Conference, 2000.</cite>

### Less Anxiety
>Music students demonstrate less test anxiety and performance anxiety than students who do not study music.<cite>“College-Age Musicians Emotionally Healthier than Non-Musician Counterparts,” Houston Chronicle, 1998.</cite>

### Most Medical Students are Musicians
Physician and biologist Lewis Thomas studied the undergraduate majors of medical school applicants. He found that 66% of music majors who applied to medical school were admitted, the highest percentage of any group. 44% of biochemistry majors were admitted. As reported in “The Case for Music in the Schools,” Phi Delta Kappan, February 1994.

## BENEFITS FOR ADULTS
>Music making makes the elderly healthier…. There were significant decreases in anxiety, depression, and loneliness following keyboard lessons. These are factors that are critical in coping with stress, stimulating the immune system, and in improved health. Results also show significant increases in human growth hormones following the same group keyboard lessons. (Human growth hormone is implicated in aches and pains.) <cite>Dr. Frederick Tims, reported in AMC Music News, June 2, 1999</cite>

### Exercises Brain
>Scientists have found that music involves the left, right, front, and back portions of the brain.<cite>Donald Hodges, “Neuromusical Research.” Handbook of Music Psychology (San Antonio: IMR Press, 1996).</cite>

### Boosts Productivity
>Music can boost productivity in the workplace. Businesses like AT&T, DuPont, and Equitable Life Insurance have cut training time in half, increased output, and raised efficiency with creative music programs. <cite>Business Music: A Performance Tool for the Office/Workplace (Seattle: Muzak, 1991).</cite>

### Lowers Temperature, Blood Pressure, etc
>Music can affect body temperature because of its influence on blood circulation, pulse rate, breathing, and sweating. Transcendent music and loud music can raise our body heat a few degrees, while soft music with a weak beat can lower it.<cite>Don Campbell, The Mozart Effect (New York: Avon Books, 1997), 70-71.</cite>
