# Policies

For the success of students and smoothly running lessons, please be aware of our policies regarding lessons, practice, and curriculum.

## Lessons

30 minutes lessons are offered once a week. In this time a Hannah's Studio teacher will teach new material, incorporate ear training and technique exercises, and line the student out for the following week. **Each student must commit to practice (depending on age and accomplishment) 3-5 times a week excluding the lesson**. If this is not possible then the success of the student will fall short. The teacher is responsible for teaching all new information and lining out the practice details for the week.

### What you Need

A piano or keyboard; spiral notebook; lesson books (will be assigned on first lesson) and, eventually, a metronome. 

## Cancellations

If a lesson is missed, a make-up lessons will be offered on the last Friday of every month. If this is not a possibility you may try to work something out with your teacher. 

If your teacher cancels, a make-up lesson will be offered, but if this is not an option, a refund will be added to your account.
