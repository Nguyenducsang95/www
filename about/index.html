Students interest and abilities vary when entering the studio. With this in mind students will follow a personalized study course. Please take time to read all of the information below so that you gain insight into how Hannah’s Studio operates.</p><h2>Teaching Philosophy</h2><p>The Studio’s philosophy is one based on stimulating the students desire to learn. This is done through a balance of theory, ear training, and creative compositions. We believe that students acheive more through inspiration than obligation.</p><aside class=pull-quote>Optimal musical development involves a balance between theory, performance, composition and ear training.</aside><p>In working with <strong>adult students</strong> we have a faster pace program available that combines theory and ear training to allow adults the ability to play improvisational chord progressions, meaning they can play most popular songs (including religious and Christmas) within a short period of time.</p><h3>Composition</h3><p>Throughout the teaching year, students are assigned composers to study their technique and style of composition. They then mimic aspects of this composer’s work in their own piece. Songwriting, with lyrical emphasis, is also overseen and guided in those who show initiative and desire.</p><h3>Performance</h3><p>Hannah’s Studio hosts 2 Piano Recitals every year. There is a Spring recital and a Christmas recital that students are encouraged to participate in. The basic performance skills are taught before and it is an opportunity for family and friends to share in the students progress.</p><h3>Theory</h3><p>Theory is extremely important to the overall growth of any musician. Some testing is involved to make sure that the student is consistently progressing. Composition reinforces the theory one has learned as they are challenged to application not just memorization. One may choose to enter a theory testing program. (Additional costs are required for these events.)</p><h3>Ear Training</h3><p>Students begin to learn scales early on and then move into interval training and, finally, chord recognition. Students learn to apply the use of the ear as soon as possible. Some students have a natural ear and this is encouraged at Hannah’s Studio. We believe that a natural musician must be balanced however, so the incorporation of technique will help the student work on their weaknesses while using their strengths.</p></article><div class=endorsements><article class="endorsement hidden"><blockquote>I have been studying piano with Hannah Elster for about three years. I love music, but have never had quite the artistic fiber. I was therefore lucky to find a very patient teacher. Piano is my favorite instrument, and also one, if not the most, difficult to learn. As an adult student, I do not always have enough time to practice in between lessons. I am fortunate that my teacher respects my pace, is flexible and as a result, we progress well. <cite>Isabelle L.</cite></blockquote></article><article class="endorsement hidden"><blockquote>It is with great pleasure that I highly recommend Hannah Elster as an excellent piano teacher. I have had the pleasure of knowing Hannah for seven years. She taught my children piano for two years before she and her family moved to Austin. Hannah is an immensely talented pianist and musician who also possess a natural gift of teaching. She maintains a high standard of excellence while balancing her teacher/student relationship in a very caring and concerned way. Hannah has an extensive piano repertoire and many practical suggestions for tackling challenging situations a student may experience while learning to play the piano. She not only teaches the student how to read music and play the piano, but also how write and compose his or her own music. My son and daughter, now in high school, still have a wonderful love for music and continue to play the piano. <cite>Cathy Coale</cite></blockquote></article><article class="endorsement hidden"><blockquote>As a piano instructor myself, I see firsthand the success of Hannah's methods. Having the flexibility to offer varied approaches, based on the students' strengths leads to great success and continued interest. Additionally, when we teach students to use their ears, their eyes and their natural inclinations to create lovely music, the outcome is more often pleasant...and accurate! I have seen students excel with a chord-based approach. I have seen students excel with ear training and music memory but above all, the students taught in Hannah's Studio have achieved success in learning to read music, playing with proper technique and producing music that is pleasing to play and pleasing to hear. In short, Hannah's Studio is well established in creating musicians. Leading students to enjoy music through learning it well is a joy, and it's something that Hannah does well! <cite>Elizabeth Furgeson</cite></blockquote></article><article class="endorsement hidden"><blockquote>I highly recommend Hannah Elster as a piano teacher. Hannah worked with our son his first 2 years of piano and had she not moved from our town would still be working with him. She is a rigorous teacher which satisfied me, but she also managed to teach a lesson that was fun for our son. I was pleased that she taught theory from the get go. Our son advanced steadily under her teaching. <cite>Jenny Wieser</cite></blockquote></article><article class="endorsement hidden"><blockquote>Hannah taught beginner lessons to my school age daughter for several years, when Hannah was teaching in our area. Over that time, my daughter's piano skills developed beautifully. Hannah was encouraging and kind to her and supported me when I needed her to help me get my daughter to commit to her practice times. This strong foundation really helped my daughter to grow confident in her skills ­ and helped instill a lifelong love of piano and music. Now, as a pianist with around 6­&ndash;7 years of experience, she continues playing, takes advanced lessons and even plays for daily school assembly and school concerts. (And I never have to ask her to practice!) <cite>Kristin Ashman</cite></blockquote></article><article class="endorsement hidden"><blockquote>Mrs. Elster taught both of my children for several years. Her encouraging teaching style gave my young beginners courage at the piano, while her high expectations built their confidence. I was glad to see them learn not just the mechanics of the keyboard, but also the language of music theory. I would highly recommend Mrs. Elster to any family looking to begin or continue music instruction. <cite>Amy Martin</cite></blockquote></article></div></div></div><footer id=footer class=container><nav><ul><li><a href="/" title=Home>Home</a></li><li><a href=/about title="About Hannah&#x27;s Studio" class=active>About</a></li><li><a href=/lessons title="Piano and Guitar Lessons">Lessons</a></li><li><a href=/policies title=Policies>Policies</a></li><li><a href=/why-piano title="Why Learn Piano?">Why Piano</a></li></ul></nav><div itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/LocalBusiness><span itemprop=name>Hannah's Studio</span><div itemprop=address itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/PostalAddress><span itemprop=streetAddress>158 Woodland Dr</span> <span itemprop=addressLocality>Greenville</span>, <span itemprop=addressRegion>SC</span> <span itemprop=postalCode>29617</span></div>Phone: <span itemprop=telephone>(864)501-3881</span></div></footer></div><script src=/scripts/endorsements.js></script></body></html>
