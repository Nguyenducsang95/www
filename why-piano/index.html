He found that 66% of music majors who applied to medical school were admitted, the highest percentage of any group. 44% of biochemistry majors were admitted. As reported in <cite>“The Case for Music in the Schools,” Phi Delta Kappan, February 1994</cite></p><h2>BENEFITS FOR ADULTS</h2><blockquote><p>“Music making makes the elderly healthier…. There were significant decreases in anxiety, depression, and loneliness following keyboard lessons. These are factors that are critical in coping with stress, stimulating the immune system, and in improved health. Results also show significant increases in human growth hormones following the same group keyboard lessons. (Human growth hormone is implicated in aches and pains.)” <cite>Dr. Frederick Tims, reported in AMC Music News, June 2, 1999</cite></p></blockquote><h3>Exercises Brain</h3><blockquote><p>Scientists have found that music involves the left, right, front, and back portions of the brain.<cite>Donald Hodges, “Neuromusical Research.” Handbook of Music Psychology (San Antonio: IMR Press, 1996).</cite></p></blockquote><h3>Boosts Productivity</h3><blockquote><p>Music can boost productivity in the workplace. Businesses like AT&amp;T, DuPont, and Equitable Life Insurance have cut training time in half, increased output, and raised efficiency with creative music programs. <cite>Business Music: A Performance Tool for the Office/Workplace (Seattle: Muzak, 1991).</cite></p></blockquote><h3>Lowers Temperature, Blood Pressure, etc</h3><blockquote><p>Music can affect body temperature because of its influence on blood circulation, pulse rate, breathing, and sweating. Transcendent music and loud music can raise our body heat a few degrees, while soft music with a weak beat can lower it.<cite>Don Campbell, The Mozart Effect (New York: Avon Books, 1997), 70-71.</cite></p></blockquote></article><article class=endorsement><blockquote>I have been studying piano with Hannah Elster for about three years. I love music, but have never had quite the artistic fiber. I was therefore lucky to find a very patient teacher. Piano is my favorite instrument, and also one, if not the most, difficult to learn. As an adult student, I do not always have enough time to practice in between lessons. I am fortunate that my teacher respects my pace, is flexible and as a result, we progress well.</blockquote><footer>Isabelle L</footer></article></div></div><footer class=container><nav><ul><li><a href="/" title=Home>Home</a></li><li><a href=/about title="About Hannah&#x27;s Studio">About</a></li><li><a href=/lessons title="Piano and Guitar Lessons">Lessons</a></li><li><a href=/policies title=Policies>Policies</a></li><li><a href=/why-piano title="Why Learn Piano?">Why Piano</a></li></ul></nav><div itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/LocalBusiness><span itemprop=name>Hannah's Studio</span><div itemprop=address itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/PostalAddress><span itemprop=streetAddress>158 Woodland Dr</span> <span itemprop=addressLocality>Greenville</span>, <span itemprop=addressRegion>SC</span> <span itemprop=postalCode>29617</span></div>Phone: <span itemprop=telephone>(512)550-8700</span></div></footer></div></body></html>
